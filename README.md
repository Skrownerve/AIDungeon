# Evren's Stable thadunge2 fork of AIDungeon2
## Maintained lovingly for the AI Dungeon [Discord community](https://discord.gg/Dg8Vcz6)
My intent with this fork is to maintain a clean and stable copy of the excellent thadunge2 fork, where we are not at the mercy of another dev team who may push changes we don't like or cause instability. I mean no disrespect to the creators/maintainers of the fork. I only wish to have a stable version for the community to enjoy.

I will slowly move up through the updates to thadunge2 as I am able to test them for stability. If you would like to help with this testing, please ping me in the Discord server @Evren#1025.

What follows are the available Colabs I have prepared for playing this fork:

My to-do list:
+ Learn how to use requirements.txt to shorten install code cell
+ Finish this fork and release the initial, stable version
+ Add links to the guide and other resources
+ Potentially utilize the wiki
+ Play with the code to remove unnecessary features/add custom stuff to title image
