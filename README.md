# Evren's Stable thadunge2 fork of AIDungeon2
## Maintained lovingly for the AI Dungeon [Discord community](https://discord.gg/Dg8Vcz6)
My intent with this fork is to maintain a clean and stable copy of the excellent thadunge2 fork, where we are not at the mercy of another dev team who may push changes we don't like or cause instability. I mean no disrespect to the creators/maintainers of the fork. I only wish to have a stable version for the community to enjoy.

I will slowly move up through the updates to thadunge2 as I am able to test them for stability. If you would like to help with this testing, please ping me in the Discord server @Evren#1025.

What follows are the available Colabs I have prepared for playing this fork:

+ Standard Colab: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/19_0khNTwlKGYfWRhm7-ZHUGlX3mX9AfD
+ Simplified Colab (recommended for trying out the fork with minimal effort): https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1caJXC3YlCl1qVliQ-Z84KByR04lCx70-
+ Screen Reader Optimized: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1k9gyOeyS4fZE5zqlzg64pnY9yEzatzTQ

My to-do list:
+ Potentially utilize the wiki
+ Play with the code to remove unnecessary features/add custom stuff to title image
